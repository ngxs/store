We announced a new idea called [NGXS Labs](https://github.com/ngxs-labs). The goal of NGXS Labs is to more clearly communicate the balance between new explorations by the team, with the normal stability that our community has come to expect since the release of NGXS.

### Emitter

This package allows you to get rid of actions. You can use decorators to register actions directly in your state, you don't have to create any actions in your project (until you really need them), as they don't give any profit, only bring extra boilerplate files.
