## ❓ What is NGXS?

NGXS is a state management pattern + library for Angular. It acts as a single source of
truth for your application's state, providing simple rules for predictable state mutations.

NGXS is modeled after the CQRS pattern popularly implemented in libraries like Redux and NgRx
but reduces boilerplate by using modern TypeScript features such as classes and decorators.

## 🌱 Does NGXS work with Ivy?

Yes, it does, and very easily. Check out the [NGXS Ivy migration guide](https://ngxs.io/advanced/ivy-migration-guide) for details.

## 👋 New to NGXS?

If you're just getting started with NGXS, I recommend you head over to the [concepts](concepts/intro.md)
and then explore the rich ecosystem of examples in the [community resources](community/projects.md) page.
