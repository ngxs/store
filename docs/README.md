### ‚ùì What is NGXS?

NGXS is a state management pattern + library for Angular. It acts as a single source of truth for your application's state, providing simple rules for predictable state mutations.

NGXS is modeled after the CQRS pattern popularly implemented in libraries like Redux and NgRx but reduces boilerplate by using modern TypeScript features such as classes and decorators.

### üëã New to NGXS?

If you're just getting started with NGXS, I recommend you head over to the [concepts](ngxs/intro.md) and then explore the rich ecosystem of examples in the [community resources](community-and-labs/community/projects.md) page.
