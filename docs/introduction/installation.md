# Installation

## Installing with schematics

You can install the `ngxs/store` using `ng-add` schematic

```bash
ng add @ngxs/store
```

Note: This command will prompt you to choose the **plugins** you want to install and the name of the **project** you want to use NGXS with.

You have the option to enter the options yourself

```bash
ng add @ngxs/store --plugins DEVTOOLS,FORM --project angular-ngxs-project
```

| Option    | Description                                               | Default Value               |
| :-------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------- |
| --project | Name of the project as it is defined in your angular.json | Workspace's default project |
| --plugins | Comma separate the plugins as appear below                |                             |

### Plugins to optionally install using the schematics

- DEVTOOLS
- FORM
- HMR
- LOGGER
- ROUTER
- STORAGE
- STORE
- WEBSOCKET

You can find more information about plugins on the [plugins page](https://www.ngxs.io/plugins).

ðŸª„ **This command will**:

- Update `package.json` dependencies with `@ngxs/store`
- Install dependencies by executing `npm install`

If your project is standalone one:

- Update the `providers` array of your selected project array with `provideStore()`

If your application is module based:

- Update the `imports` array of your `app.module.ts` with `NgxsModule.forRoot([])`

## Manual Installation

To get started, install the package from npm. The latest version (3.x) supports Angular/RxJS 6+, if you want support for Angular 5, use version 2.x.

```bash
npm install @ngxs/store --save

# or if you are using yarn
yarn add @ngxs/store
```

then in `app.module.ts`, import the `NgxsModule`:

```ts
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { NgxsModule } from '@ngxs/store';

import { ZooState } from './examples/zoo.state';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    NgxsModule.forRoot([ZooState], {
      developmentMode: !environment.production
    })
  ]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

When you include the module in the import, you can pass root stores along with [options](../advanced/options.md).
If you are lazy loading, you can use the `forFeature` option with the same arguments.

Options such as `developmentMode` can be passed to the module as the second argument in the `forRoot` method.
In development mode, plugin authors can add additional runtime checks/etc to enhance the developer experience. Switching
to development mode will also freeze your store using [deep-freeze-strict](https://www.npmjs.com/package/deep-freeze-strict)
module.

It's important that you add `NgxsModule.forRoot([])` at the root of your module even if
all of your states are feature states.

## Development Builds

Our continuous integration server runs all tests on every commit to master and if they pass it will publish a new development build to NPM and tag it with the @dev tag.

This means that if you want the bleeding edge of `@ngxs/store` or any of the plugins you can simply do:

```bash
npm install @ngxs/store@dev --save
npm install @ngxs/logger-plugin@dev --save

# or if you are using yarn
yarn add @ngxs/store@dev
yarn add @ngxs/logger-plugin@dev

# of if you want to update multiple things at the same time
yarn add @ngxs/{store,logger-plugin,devtools-plugin}@dev
```

This will install the version currently tagged as `@dev`.
Your package.json file will be locked to that specific version.

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@ngxs/store": "3.0.0-dev.a0d076d"
  }
}
```

If you later want to again update to the bleeding edge, you will have to run the above command again.
