# Schematics

This page lists all the different schematics that can be used to generate NGXS Starter-Kit, Store, Actions and State.

## Starter Kit

The Starter Kit provides a pre-configured NGXS setup that includes a Store, State, Actions, and selectors.

See the [Starter Kit Page](starter-kit.md) to learn more.

## Store

The store is a global state manager that dispatches actions your state containers listen to and provides a way to select data slices out from the global state.

See the [Store Page](../concepts/store/) to learn more.

## Actions

Actions can either be thought of as a command which should trigger something to happen, or as the resulting event of something that has already happened.

See the [Actions Page](../concepts/actions/) to learn more.

## State

States are classes that define a state container.

See the [State Page](../concepts/state/) to learn more.
