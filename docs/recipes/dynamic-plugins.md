# Dynamic Plugins

Angular provides the capability to avoid bundling development only packages. There packages
are `@ngxs/devtools-plugin` and `@ngxs/logger-plugin`. You would want to use these packages
only during development and not in production.

Let's look at the code below:

```ts
// environment.ts
import { NgxsLoggerPluginModule } from '@ngxs/logger-plugin';
import { NgxsReduxDevtoolsPluginModule } from '@ngxs/devtools-plugin';

export const environment = {
  production: false,
  plugins: [NgxsLoggerPluginModule.forRoot(), NgxsReduxDevtoolsPluginModule.forRoot()]
};
```

This means that these plugins will be used only when Angular uses `environment.ts` file, but in
the production build it will be replaced with `environment.prod.ts` file (or any other configuration you use).
If you already figured out the `environment.prod.ts` file will contain `plugins` property that equals empty array, the code would
look as follows:

```ts
// environment.prod.ts
export const environment = {
  production: true,
  plugins: []
};
```

All we have left to do is to import the environment file and reference `plugins` property in the `AppModule` imports:

```ts
import { NgxsModule } from '@ngxs/store';

import { environment } from '../environments/environment';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    NgxsModule.forRoot([]),
    environment.plugins
  ]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

This approach will reduce your production bundle size, as these packages are only needed during development.
