## Installation

```bash
npm install @ngxs/devtools-plugin --save-dev

# or if you are using yarn
yarn add @ngxs/devtools-plugin --dev
```

## Usage

Add the `NgxsReduxDevtoolsPluginModule` plugin to your root app module:

```ts
import { NgxsModule } from '@ngxs/store';
import { NgxsReduxDevtoolsPluginModule } from '@ngxs/devtools-plugin';

@NgModule({
  imports: [NgxsModule.forRoot([]), NgxsReduxDevtoolsPluginModule.forRoot()]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

### Options

The plugin supports the following options passed via the `forRoot` method:

- `name`: Set the name by which this store instance is referenced in devtools (Default: 'NGXS')
- `disabled`: Disable the devtools during production
- `maxAge`: Max number of entries to keep.
- `latency`: If more than one action is dispatched in the indicated interval, all new actions will be collected and sent at once.
  It is the joint between performance and speed. When set to 0, all actions will be sent instantly.
  Set it to a higher value when experiencing perf issues (also maxAge to a lower value). Default is 500 ms.
- `actionsBlacklist`: string or array of strings as regex - actions types to be hidden in the monitors (while passed to the reducers).
  If actionsWhitelist specified, actionsBlacklist is ignored.
- `actionsWhitelist`: string or array of strings as regex - actions types to be shown in the monitors (while passed to the reducers).
  If actionsWhitelist specified, actionsBlacklist is ignored.
- `predicate`: called for every action before sending, takes state and action object, and
  returns true in case it allows sending the current data to the monitor.
  Use it as a more advanced version of actionsBlacklist/actionsWhitelist parameters
- `actionSanitizer`: Reformat actions before sending to dev tools
- `stateSanitizer`: Reformat state before sending to devtools
- `trace`: if set to `true`, will include stack trace for every dispatched action, so you can see it in trace tab jumping directly to that part of code
- `traceLimit`: maximum stack trace frames to be stored (in case trace option was provided as true)

### Notes

You should always include the devtools as the last plugin in your configuration.
For instance, if you were to include devtools before a plugin like the storage
plugin, the initial state would not be reflected.
