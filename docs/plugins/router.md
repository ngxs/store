# Router Plugin

![Router Diagram](../assets/router.png)

In the browser, the location (URL information) and session history
(a stack of locations visited by the current browser tab) are stored in the
global window object. They are accessible via:

- `window.location` ([Location API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Location))
- `window.history` ([History API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History))

Our location data is a dynamic and important part of application state-the kind
of state that belongs in a store. Holding it in the store enables devtools luxuries like
time-travel debugging, and easy access from any store-connected component.

This plugin binds that state from the Angular router to our NGXS store.

## Install
The Router plugin can be installed using NPM:

```bash
npm i @ngxs/router-plugin --S
```

## Usage
Add the `NgxsRouterPluginModule` plugin to your root app module:

```TS
import { NgxsModule } from '@ngxs/store';
import { NgxsRouterPluginModule } from '@ngxs/router-plugin';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    NgxsModule.forRoot([]),
    NgxsRouterPluginModule.forRoot()
  ]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

Now the route will be reflected in your store under the `route` state name. The
state is represented as a `RouterStateSnapshot` object.

You can also navigate using the store's dispatch method. It accepts the following
arguments: `new Navigate(path: any[], queryParams?: Params, extras?: NavigationExtras)`.
A simple example would be navigating to the admin page like this:

```TS
import { Store } from '@ngxs/store';
import { Navigate } from '@ngxs/router-plugin';

@Component({ ... })
export class MyApp {

  constructor(private store: Store) {}

  onClick() {
    this.store.dispatch(new Navigate('/admin'))
  }

}
```

You can use action handlers to listen to state changes in your components
and services by subscribing to the `RouterNavigation`, `RouterCancel` or `RouterError`
action classes.
