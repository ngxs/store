## 2.0 Release - 3/27/18
Today we launched 2.0, a huge improvement from our 1.0 release. Its really exciting
to see the community come together to make this a truley great project! We had
quite a few breaking changes over the duration of the 2.0 release and I want to 
appologize for that. The 1.0 release was me working in a silo, as the community
started using it and having ideas it evolved quite a bit and I wanted to get that
feedback integrated as soon as possible so we have a great foundation to start off.
I can assure you moving forward we will have proper deprecation cycles before any
breaking changes so please dont worry about that. Looking forward to the next release,
we have lots planned around new plugins and big core features under the hood like
cancellable actions and whatnot so stay tuned for updates!
