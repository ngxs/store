# Welcome to the NGXS Tutorial!

Let's build a Todo application together while diving into the core concepts of NGXS. This interactive tutorial will guide you through the process of managing your application's state effectively.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to:

- Install NGXS into your Angular project using schematics
- Understand the fundamental building blocks of NGXS: Actions, State, and Selectors
- Create a Todo application using NGXS, demonstrating a practical application of these concepts

**We'll start by focusing on Actions as the driving force behind our application.** We'll explore how to:

- Define Actions to represent user interactions and data fetching
- Update the application's state in response to Actions
- Create Selectors to efficiently retrieve data from the state
- Utilize Selectors within your components to display and interact with the state

> This tutorial begins with a static Todo application displayed in the preview panel. Progressively, we'll transform this app into a dynamic, state-managed application.
> To get familiar with the tutorial, add one incomplete item in the `todo-list-component.ts` file

**Ready to get started?** Let's build!
