// By default, collection.json is a Loose-format JSON5 format, which means it's loaded using a
// special loader and you can use comments, as well as single quotes or no-quotes for standard
// JavaScript identifiers.
// Note that this is only true for collection.json and it depends on the tooling itself.
// We read package.json using a require() call, which is standard JSON.

  // Schematics are listed as a map of schematicName => schematicDescription.
  // Each description contains a description field which is required, a factory reference,
  // an extends field and a schema reference.
  // The extends field points to another schematic (either in the same collection or a
  // separate collection using the format collectionName:schematicName).
  // The factory is required, except when using the extends field. Then the factory can
  // overwrite the extended schematic factory.
