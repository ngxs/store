/**
 * This function serves as a utility and has multiple purposes.
 * Firstly, it allows you to select properties from the state class
 * without having to inject the store class and use `this.store.selectSignal`,
 * resulting in a more concise implementation. Secondly, it can be used with
 * other solutions such as NgRx signal store with its `signalStoreFeature` or
 * `withComputed` functionalities.
 *
 * Please note that it's named `select` instead of `selectSignal` because
 * signals are evolving into first-class primitives in Angular, displacing other
 * primitives such as observables. Observables represent a stream of events,
 * whereas signals represent a single value changing over time.
