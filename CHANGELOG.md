# 2.0.0-rc.0 3/17/18
First off, 2.0 is a huge change. I want to appologize to everyone about that but
given all the community feedback and ideas, I really wanted to get these ideas in
before it was too late and we were stuck on a API. I can promise that there will
not be this big of a breaking change after this release in the future without 
first deprecation periods.
