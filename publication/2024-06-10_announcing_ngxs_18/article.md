# Announcing NGXS 18

We're thrilled to announce the release of NGXS v18! This update represents months of hard work by the NGXS team, focused on strengthening the library's core functionalities while maintaining its signature ease of use.

But that's not all ‚Äì we've also made a strategic decision to align NGXS versioning with Angular's release cycle. This means, starting with v18, the minimum supported Angular version will also align with Angular's latest release, unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Angular has entered a new era, where the incremental introduction of new features and API changes offer a host of opportunities for libraries. This move by NGXS ensures seamless compatibility and allows you to leverage the latest features from both libraries as they evolve together.  
For NGXS v18, since this is our first release under the new versioning scheme, we will be supporting Angular versions >=16.

But before we dive in, we want to unveil a fresh new look for NGXS!

ü•Å **Drumroll please...** ü•Å

## Our Brand New Logo!!!

We're thrilled to introduce our brand new logo! We believe it better reflects the energy, innovation, and awesomeness of the NGXS library:

![The new NGXS logo. The letters N, G, x, and S are presented in a clean font. The x is presented as a lower case letter, where the rest are upper case. This distinguises the "NG" of Angular, the "x" that represents the modern Angular version placeholder and the "S", which stands for state. In the lettering, there are areas of triangular negative space that match triangles above and below the lettering. This signifies the movement of the events and data that are core elements of the library.](ngxs-logo_dark_theme.png)

A huge shoutout to [Lena Lekkou](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lenalekkou/), the talented designer who brought this logo to life! Her creativity and design expertise have given NGXS a visual identity that truly embodies its spirit.

## NGXS Community moving to Discord

We've got some exciting news in this release beyond the usual code wizardry. We're officially moving our community hub from Slack to **Discord**!

**Why Discord?**

- **Dedicated Channels:** Dive deep into specific NGXS topics with focused channels.
- **Enhanced Support:** Find answers and resources faster with a well-organized structure.

Head over to our brand new Discord server at https://discord.gg/yT3Q8cXTnz. Don't forget to introduce yourself and let us know what awesome NGXS projects you're working on!

## The move from Slack to Discord will be incremental, as we encourage our many Slack users to move over. There is a wealth of valuable community discussions in our Slack archives (6 years of data). This is unfortunately inaccessible due to Slack's 90-day policy. We plan to make this archive available in dedicated discord channels in the near future.

Now, let's get down to business!

## Standalone API

We have introduced a new, standalone API that is backward compatible with the old API. Here is a quick comparison of the two APIs:

_Before_

```ts
import { NgxsModule } from '@ngxs/store';
import { NgxsReduxDevtoolsPluginModule } from '@ngxs/devtools-plugin';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    NgxsModule.forRoot([TodosState], {
      developmentMode: !environment.production
    }),
    NgxsReduxDevtoolsPluginModule.forRoot({ disabled: environment.production })
  ]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

_After_

```ts
import { provideStore } from '@ngxs/store';
import { withNgxsReduxDevtoolsPlugin } from '@ngxs/devtools-plugin';

export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
  providers: [
    provideStore(
      [TodosState],
      { developmentMode: !environment.production },
      withNgxsReduxDevtoolsPlugin({ disabled: environment.production })
    )
  ]
};
```

The `provideStore` function is the central hub for managing your NGXS Store. This is where you register your States, configure your NGXS store, and enable any plugins that you want to use.

All NGXS plugins follow the naming convention `withNgxs{name}Plugin`. For example, the plugin for logging state changes is called `withNgxsLoggerPlugin`.

Let's explore a comprehensive list of all the plugins and how to use them using modules and the standalone API.

| Plugin     | Module                                                            | Standalone                                              |
| :--------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| DevTools   | `NgxsReduxDevtoolsPluginModule.forRoot()`                         | `withNgxsReduxDevtoolsPlugin()`                         |
| Logger     | `NgxsLoggerPluginModule.forRoot()`                                | `withNgxsLoggerPlugin()`                                |
| Storage    | `NgxsStoragePluginModule.forRoot()`                               | `withNgxsStoragePlugin()`                               |
| Forms      | `NgxsFormPluginModule.forRoot()`                                  | `withNgxsFormPlugin()`                                  |
| Router     | `NgxsRouterPluginModule.forRoot()`                                | `withNgxsRouterPlugin()`                                |
| Web Socket | `NgxsWebsocketPluginModule.forRoot({url: 'ws://localhost:4200'})` | `withNgxsWebSocketPlugin({url: 'ws://localhost:4200'})` |

### Development Options

NGXS provides a mechanism to detect actions that haven't been processed by any state in your application. This functionality is valuable for ensuring your actions are handled as expected and helps identify potential issues.

Previously, this feature was only accessible within applications built with modules. Now, NGXS offers it as a standalone API, making it even more versatile.

_Using Modules_

```ts
import { NgxsModule, NgxsDevelopmentModule } from '@ngxs/store';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    NgxsModule.forRoot([]),
    NgxsDevelopmentModule.forRoot({
      warnOnUnhandledActions: true // <-- set this flag to 'true' will warn for any unhandled actions
    })
  ]
})
```

_Using Standalone API_

```ts
import { provideStore, withNgxsDevelopmentOptions } from '@ngxs/store';

export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
  providers: [
    provideStore(
      [],
      withNgxsDevelopmentOptions({
        warnOnUnhandledActions: true // <-- set this flag to 'true' will warn for any unhandled actions
      })
    )
  ]
};
```

---

## Signals

### selectSignal

We have also introduced the `selectSignal` function, which functions similarly to `select`, but instead of returning an observable, it returns a [signal](https://angular.io/guide/signals):

```ts
import { Store } from '@ngxs/store';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-zoo',
  template: `
    @for (panda of pandas(); track $index) {
      <p>{{ panda }}</p>
    }
  `
})
export class ZooComponent {
  readonly pandas = this.store.selectSignal(ZooState.pandas);

  constructor(private store: Store) {}
}
```

The `selectSignal` function only accepts a 'typed' selector function (a function that carries type information) and a state token. For instance, providing an anonymous function like this wouldn't work:

```ts
store.selectSignal(state => state.animals.pandas);
```

We don't allow any options to be provided to the internal `computed` function, such as an equality function, because immutability is a fundamental premise for the existence of data in our state. Users should never have a reason to specify the equality comparison function.

### Signal Utilities

NGXS offers utilities for signals that can be used with other solutions, promoting modularity and flexibility. All of these utilities are located within the `@ngxs/store` package and are independent of any specific state management framework.

These utilities are:

- `select`: This utility function retrieves a signal from the state for the provided selector.
- `createSelectMap`: This utility function will convert an object where the values are selectors to an object where each property is the signal for the corresponding selector.

See the [select](https://www.ngxs.io/concepts/select/signals#select) and [createSelectMap](https://www.ngxs.io/concepts/select/signals#createselectmap) in the documentation for further details.

**NgRx SignalStore**

These utility functions can be easily integrated for use with the NgRx SignalStore solution

You can read more [here](https://www.ngxs.io/concepts/select/signals)

---

## Dispatch Utilities

- `dispatch`: This utility function takes an action as a parameter and returns a function. This function can then be called with parameters for the action constructor. When this function is called, the action is created and is dispatched immediately.
- `createDispatchMap`: This utility function accepts an object where the values are action classes

See the [dispatch](https://www.ngxs.io/concepts/store#dispatch-utility) and [createDispatchMap](https://www.ngxs.io/concepts/select/signals#createdispatchmap) in the documentation for further details.

## Schematics

With NGXS v18, schematics are now included in the main package. These schematics make it easier to use NGXS by automating the installation, and creation of common NGXS constructs, such as the Store, Actions, and State.

> Note: All the schematics support both non-standalone and standalone Angular apps.

### `ng add` Schematic

To install and auto-configure NGXS in your existing Angular application, all you have to do is to execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
ng add @ngxs/store
```

If your workspace has multiple projects, you will be prompted to select the project you want to add NGXS to.üéâ

NGXS [plugins](https://www.ngxs.io/plugins) can easily be added through this schematic too. Just choose which plugins you want to use, and we'll install the necessary packages and configure them for you automatically!

See our documentation for more information on [this schematic](https://www.ngxs.io/introduction/installation#installing-with-schematics).

### File Generation Schematics

There are various schematics available to quickly generate various NGXS files:

- Generate all store files:

  ```bash
  ng generate @ngxs/store:store
  ```

  Generates sample `state` and `actions` files in the provided location, with the provided name and generation options (see [documentation](https://www.ngxs.io/concepts/store/schematics)).

- Generate `state` file:

  ```bash
  ng generate @ngxs/store:state --name TodosState
  ```

  Will generate a sample `todos.state.ts` file in the provided location (with the provided name and generation options - see [documentation](https://www.ngxs.io/concepts/state/schematics)).

- Generate `actions` file:

  ```bash
  ng generate @ngxs/store:actions --name todos
  ```

  Will generate a sample `todos.actions.ts` file in the provided location (with the provided name and generation options - see [documentation](https://www.ngxs.io/concepts/actions/schematics)).

---

## Error Handling

NGXS provides a robust unhandled error handling mechanism that automatically catches unhandled exceptions thrown within actions. These errors are directed to a centralized `NgxsUnhandledErrorHandler`, which by default forwards the error to the Angular `ErrorHandler`.

It is [recommended](https://www.ngxs.io/concepts/store/error-handling#recommended-approach) to do error handling within your action functions in your state, but some developers have opted for approaches that rely heavily on the fallback error handling mechanisms in NGXS. In order to allow for more control over this, NGXS now allows you to override the default implementation of the `NgxsUnhandledErrorHandler` and provide a custom one to suit your particular application's needs.

You can read more [here](https://www.ngxs.io/concepts/store/error-handling#overriding-the-ngxsunhandlederrorhandler)

---

## Bug Fixes

- Show error when state initialization order is invalid [#2066](https://github.com/ngxs/store/pull/2066)

  When the `UpdateState` is dispatched before the `InitState` a `console.error` will appear, and the the state initialization order must be update. An incorrect order may prevent `ngxsOnInit` from being called on feature states or lead to other unpredictable errors.

- Log feature states added before store is initialized [#2067](https://github.com/ngxs/store/pull/2067)

  When a feature state is initialized before the `store`, will appear an error message and the state initialization order must be updated. This typically occurs when `NgxsModule.forFeature` or `provideStates` is called before `NgxsModule.forRoot` or `provideStore`.

---

## Zoneless Server-Side Rendering (experimental)

Before zoneless change detection was introduced, Angular required zone.js to be used for server-side rendering. This was necessary to determine when the application became 'stable' and could be serialized for client transmission. With zoneless change detection, Angular utilizes its internal pending tasks service. This service explicitly contributes to application stability by notifying Angular when asynchronous tasks are in progress, preventing premature serialization.

NGXS provides an experimental feature called `withExperimentalNgxsPendingTasks`, which can be registered when calling `provideStore`. This feature prevents SSR serialization before NGXS actions have been handled:

```ts
import { provideStore } from '@ngxs/store';
import { withExperimentalNgxsPendingTasks } from '@ngxs/store/experimental';

export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
  providers: [provideStore([], withExperimentalNgxsPendingTasks())]
};
```

## Breaking Changes

### Storage Plugin

We're moving towards a more explicit approach. Now, you need to define exactly which states you want the **Storage Plugin** to serialize. This gives you finer control over what data gets persisted.

- **Explicit State Selection:** You now have granular control over which states get serialized by the **Storage Plugin**. Simply specify the states you want to save in the plugin options.

- **Serialize All States:** Don't worry, if you still prefer to serialize everything, there's an option for that too!

- **Feature State Support:** This update also opens the door to serializing feature states, providing a more comprehensive persistence solution.

As mentioned earlier, you can still configure the Storage Plugin to serialize all your application states. Here's an example of how to achieve this:

_Before_

```ts
import { NgxsModule } from '@ngxs/store';
import { NgxsStoragePluginModule } from '@ngxs/storage-plugin';

@NgModule({
  imports: [NgxsStoragePluginModule.forRoot()]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

_After_

```ts
import { NgxsModule } from '@ngxs/store';
import { NgxsStoragePluginModule } from '@ngxs/storage-plugin';

@NgModule({
  imports: [NgxsStoragePluginModule.forRoot({ keys: '*' })]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

Now that we've covered serializing all states, let's explore how to pick and choose which ones get saved. This approach offers greater control and potentially improves performance, especially for larger applications.

Here's an example of how to serialize specific states:

_Before_

```ts
import { NgxsModule } from '@ngxs/store';
import { NgxsStoragePluginModule } from '@ngxs/storage-plugin';

@NgModule({
  imports: [NgxsStoragePluginModule.forRoot({ key: 'novels' })]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

_After_

```ts
import { NgxsModule } from '@ngxs/store';
import { NgxsStoragePluginModule } from '@ngxs/storage-plugin';

@NgModule({
  imports: [NgxsStoragePluginModule.forRoot({ keys: ['novels'] })]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

‚ú® We understand that updating existing code can be time-consuming. To help with this transition, the Storage Plugin offers an automatic migration feature.

This means you won't have to manually update your code to reflect the changes. The migration command will handle that for you:

```bash
ng g @ngxs/storage-plugin:keys-migration
```

### `dispatch` call return type

In previous versions, the `dispatch` function incorrectly returned an `Observable<any>`. This meant the observable could emit any type of data, including the `state` snapshot. This behavior has been rectified in this version. Now, `dispatch` correctly returns an `Observable<void>`, indicating it does not emit any values.

To see an example, let's assume that we have the state as seen below:

```ts
@State<number>({
  name: 'number',
  defaults: 0
})
@Injectable()
class MyState {
  @Action(Add)
  add(ctx: StateContext<string>, { payload }: Add) {
    return of({}).pipe(tap(() => ctx.setState(ctx.getState() + payload)));
  }
}
```

_Before_

In a previous implementation we could access the state while subscribing.

```ts
store.dispatch(new Add(10)).subscribe(state => {
  // Access the state
  console.log(state.number); // this will log 10
});
```

_After_

In this version, directly accessing the state within a subscription is not supported. To retrieve the current state value, use the `store.snapshot()` method.

```ts
store.dispatch(new Add(10)).subscribe(() => {
  // Access the state via store.snapshot()
  console.log(store.snapshot().number); // this will log 10
});
```

### Throwing errors from selectors by default

In previous versions, errors encountered in selectors were silently ignored. This behavior has changed in this version. Now, errors will be thrown explicitly.

There's a distinction in how errors are thrown based on the selection method used:

- `selectSnapshot` will throw errors synchronously.
- Errors originating from `select` will be thrown asynchronously. This is because the `RxJS` error reporter utilizes a `setTimeout` function.

It's important to note that errors are still logged in development mode for debugging purposes.

### Enforcing Typing with @Action and @Selector decorators

- `@Action` and `@Selector` decorator typings will now enforce that arguments match those declared in the respective definition. [#2158](https://github.com/ngxs/store/pull/2158) and [#2042](https://github.com/ngxs/store/pull/2042)

### Enforcing Typed Selectors in store.select, store.selectOnce, and store.selectSnapshot

For improved type safety and maintainability, these selector functions now require typed selectors as arguments. This means raw state classes or anonymous functions are no longer accepted.

If your selectors are already typed, you don't need any modifications. For example, `this.store.selectSnapshot(CounterState.getState)` remains valid.

**Addressing Untyped Selectors:**

If you were using untyped selectors like `this.store.selectSnapshot(CounterState)`, you have two options:

1. **State Tokens**: Utilize state tokens for improved type safety. Here's an example:

   ```ts
   // Define a state token for CounterState
   export const COUNTER_STATE_TOKEN = new StateToken<number>('counter');

   // Update CounterState to use the token
   @State<number>({
     name: COUNTER_STATE_TOKEN, // Use the token instead of 'counter'
     defaults: 0
   })
   @Injectable()
   class CounterState {}
   ```

   With this change, your selector becomes:

   ```ts
   this.store.selectSnapshot(COUNTER_STATE_TOKEN);
   ```

2. **Typed Selectors**: Alternatively, create a typed selector that returns the state itself. Here's an example:

   2.a Using the createSelector util

   ```ts
   export namespace CounterQueries {
     export const getState = createSelector([CounterState], (state: number) => state);
   }
   ```

   With this approach, your selector becomes:

   ```ts
   this.store.selectSnapshot(CounterQueries.getState);
   ```

   2.b Using the deprecated @Selector decorator

   ```ts
   @State<number>({
     name: COUNTER_STATE_TOKEN, // Use the token instead of 'counter'
     defaults: 0
   })
   @Injectable()
   class CounterState {
     @Selector()
     static getState(state: Todo[]) {
       return state;
     }
   }
   ```

   With this approach, your selector becomes:

   ```ts
   this.store.selectSnapshot(CounterState.getState);
   ```

### Container state is not injected by default

In selectors decorated with `@Selector()`, the behavior depends on whether parameters are provided:

- **No Parameters**: Without any parameters, the selector relies implicitly on the state container. Any change to the state container will trigger a recalculation of the selector's value. This can be inefficient if the selector doesn't directly use the entire state container.

  > There is no breaking change in this behavior.

  ```ts
  @State<NotificationModel>({
    name: 'notifications'
  })
  class NotificationsState {
    @Selector()
    static getNotifications(state: NotificationsStateModel) {
      return state.notifications;
    }
  }
  ```

- **Parameters**: When you specify selector functions (`selectorFn1`, `selectorFn2`, etc.) as parameters to `@Selector()`, the selector only recalculates when one of those specific functions changes. This provides more granular control and avoids unnecessary recalculations.

  In previous versions the State Container was injected as first argument in the selector function and the selector was recalculated on any state change.

  > This is a breaking change.

  _Before_

  ```ts
  @State<NotificationModel>({
    name: 'notifications'
  })
  class NotificationsState {
    @Selector([NotificationsState.getNotifications])
    static getUnreadTotal(state: NotificationsStateModel, notifications: Notification[]) {
      return notifications.reduce(() => ..., 0);
    }
  }
  ```

  _After_\*

  ```ts
  @State<NotificationModel>({
    name: 'notifications'
  })
  class NotificationsState {
    @Selector([NotificationsState.getNotifications])
    static getUnreadTotal(notifications: Notification[]) { // Note that the first argument isn't the State Container
      return notifications.reduce(() => ..., 0);
    }
  }
  ```

## Deprecations

### Select Decorator

The `@Select` decorator is slated for removal in the future due to its inherent risks. It lacks integration with Angular's dependency injection system, making it prone to failures in scenarios with multiple simultaneous applications, such as server-side rendering and microfrontend setups.

You can read more [here](https://www.ngxs.io/deprecations/select-decorator-deprecation)

### Sub States

We're planning to remove the option to declare sub-states on the state using the `children` property. This feature was introduced years ago to address certain issues, but it's not technically beneficial and doesn't add any value.

You can read more [here](https://www.ngxs.io/deprecations/sub-states-deprecation)

---

## Exposed Internals (for Advanced Development)

The store and plugin exposes some of its internal API implementations to allow library authors to experiment with potential extensions. However, keep in mind that these API implementations are not part of the official API, but rather an internals API. This means that they could be changed at any time in the future. Let's see some of their details:

> _Please note the `barred O` symbol which denotes it's not part of the official API_

**Store**

The exposed functions are:

- `…µSelectorFunc`
- `…µStateSelector`
- `…µSelectorDef`
- `…µSelectorReturnType`

They might be utilized by developers working on advanced utilities who need access to these types externally. For example, they may create a function that accepts selector functions and returns signals with types corresponding to the return types of those selectors.

**Router Plugin**

The exposed tokens and function are:

- `…µNGXS_ROUTER_PLUGIN_OPTIONS`
- `…µUSER_OPTIONS`
- `…µcreateRouterPluginOptions`

You can import them using this path `@ngxs/router-plugin/internals` as seen below:

---

**Storage Plugin**

The exposed tokens and function are:

- `…µDEFAULT_STATE_KEY`

  The storage plugin's key [option](https://www.ngxs.io/plugins/storage#options) allows you to specify which state slices should be persisted in storage. If you don't provide any state names, the plugin will persist all states using the `@@STATE` key. You can now use the `…µDEFAULT_STATE_KEY` token to provide an alternative to `@@STATE`.

- `…µFINAL_NGXS_STORAGE_PLUGIN_OPTIONS`,
- `…µNGXS_STORAGE_PLUGIN_OPTIONS`,
- `…µextractStringKey`,
- `…µisKeyWithExplicitEngine`,
- `…µcreateFinalStoragePluginOptions`

  As of today, SSR apps can use custom storage engine implementations instead of relying on `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`.
  This new internal API gives you the flexibility to further customize your storage solution.

You can import them using this path `@ngxs/storage-plugin/internals`.
